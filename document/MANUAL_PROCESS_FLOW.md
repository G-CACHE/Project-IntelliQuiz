## **PROCESS 5: ACCESS & PERMISSIONS MANAGEMENT**

### **Current Manual Steps:**

**Step 5.1: Instructor Access Requests**
1. New instructor sends email to Quiz Admin requesting access
2. Includes information:
   - Name and department
   - Topics/quizzes needed
   - Purpose (teaching, training, assessment)
3. Quiz Admin manually reviews request
4. Approves or denies

**Step 5.2: Permission Assignment (Manual)**

## **PROCESS 6: QUIZ HISTORY & ANALYTICS**

### **Current Manual Steps:**

**Step 6.1: Historical Data Collection**
1. All past quiz results stored in:
   - Filing cabinets (paper)
   - Email archives
   - Scattered spreadsheets
   - Shared drive folders (poorly organized)

**Step 6.2: Reporting**
1. If admin needs historical data:
   - Manually searches through files
   - Collects spreadsheets

The IntelliQuiz system was created to address these challenges by:

✅ **Automation**: Reduce manual data entry and calculations
✅ **Real-time Engagement**: Immediate feedback and interactive gameplay
✅ **Scalability**: Run multiple quizzes simultaneously
✅ **Remote Access**: Quizzes accessible anywhere (not just in-person)
✅ **Analytics**: Automatic performance tracking and reporting
✅ **Centralized Management**: All quiz data in one place
✅ **Accessibility**: Visual interface for all abilities
✅ **Cost Reduction**: Eliminate printing and archive storage
✅ **Audit Trail**: Track who did what and when
✅ **Consistency**: Standardized process across all quizzes

---

## 8. CONCLUSION

The manual process for conducting quizzes is:
- **Time-intensive**: 3-5 hours per quiz session
- **Error-prone**: Manual score tracking leads to mistakes
- **Limited**: Hard to scale or add new features
- **Inefficient**: Staff spending time on repetitive tasks
- **Lacking insights**: No data-driven improvements possible

IntelliQuiz addresses these gaps by providing:
- **Automated question management** (versioning, permissions, storage)
- **Self-service team registration** (no manual data entry)
- **Live quiz platform** (auto-calculation, instant feedback)
- **Performance analytics** (identify trends, improve content)
- **Centralized access control** (manage permissions easily)
- **Audit & compliance** (track all system usage)
